# Hotel Booking Analysis with MZ Score

This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data with a focus on MZ Score (or any specific score relevant to the dataset). The goal of this project is to explore key factors impacting hotel bookings, cancellations, and customer satisfaction scores, providing insights for improving hotel booking strategies and enhancing customer experience.

## Project Overview

This notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Import and clean the dataset, handling any missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize patterns in booking data, including customer demographics, booking lead times, and cancellation rates.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create or transform features, such as calculating MZ Scores or encoding categorical variables to improve analysis.
4. **Modeling and Prediction**: If applicable, train models to predict booking outcomes, such as likelihood of cancellation or customer satisfaction.
5. **Result Interpretation**: Analyze model outcomes and key insights from the EDA to understand significant factors in hotel booking behaviors.

## Requirements

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizing data trends
- `scikit-learn`: For building and evaluating predictive models (if modeling is included)

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure that the hotel booking dataset is accessible within the notebookâ€™s directory.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the data cleaning, analysis, and results.
3. **Interpret the Visualizations**: Use the visualizations and analysis provided to gain insights into factors affecting hotel bookings and customer behavior.

## Example Outputs

Key outputs include:

- **Heatmaps**: Show correlations between booking features and outcomes.
- **Distribution Plots**: Visualize customer demographics and booking behavior.
- **Model Performance (if applicable)**: Evaluation metrics for any predictive models.
